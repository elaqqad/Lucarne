				<h2>What are the interesting features of gluX ?</h2>
			</b>I tried to make gluX 'developer friendly': if an extension is not loaded it 
			exits with a nice message instead of crashing because of a NULL pointer access. 
			The perl script allows you to easily add extensions by updating the <i>glext.h</i>
			file. Another interest of gluX is its ability to make a difference between a 
			required extension and an optional extension. Also, the query for checking if 
			an extension is available is very fast (see <a href="doc.html">documentation</a>
			and GLUX_IS_AVAILABLE macro).<br>
			GluX tries to load an extension even if the driver report that the extension is 
			not present. This is usually the case when an extension is in development.
			<br>

				<h2>How can I use a <i>wgl</i> extension ?</h2>
			</b>It is very simple: let's say you want to use the <i>GL_NV_vertex_array_range</i>
			extension. This extension is making use of plateform depedent functions 
			wglAllocateMemoryNV and wglFreeMemoryNV to allocate / free memory. Therefore 
			you also need to load the <i>WGL_NV_vertex_array_range</i> extension:
			<pre>
GLUX_REQUIRE(GL_NV_vertex_array_range);
GLUX_REQUIRE(WGL_NV_vertex_array_range);
</pre>
		And then you can call the functions wglAllocateMemoryNV and wglFreeMemoryNV.

			<b>
				<h2>Why do I have link problems when compiling a program with gluX under Windows ?</h2>
			</b>There is four versions of the gluX library for windows:
			<ul>
				<li>
				gluX Visual C++ 6, single thread (lib/win32/vc6)
				<li>
				gluX Visual C++ 6, multi-thread (lib/win32/vc6)
				<li>
				gluX Visual C++ .NET, single thread (lib/win32/vc7.net)
				<li>
					gluX Visual C++ .NET, multi-thread (lib/win32/vc7.net)</li>
			</ul>
		Check that you are compiling with the correct version of the library. If you 
		are using the SDL library (or any other multi-threaded library like qt-mt), you 
		should link with the multi-thread version of gluX.
		<P></P>
		<p>
		</p>
		<H2>An OpenGL function is missing ! (exemple: <EM>glBlendColor</EM>)</H2>
		gluX is created by parsing latest OpenGL header files. These headers are 
		present in the <EM>glux\script</EM> directory. If you are using older headers 
		(as it is often the case under Windows), some functions that used to be 
		extensions but have since be included in OpenGL might be missed. <EM>glBlendColor</EM>
		is one of those. To fix this issue, simply include the OpenGL headers located 
		in the script directory (they have to be renamed without the reg_ prefix: <EM>reg_glext.h 
			=&gt; glext.h</EM>). Also, in the case of <EM>glBlendColor</EM>, another 
		extension defines the function <EM>glBlendColorEXT</EM> . You can find the latest 
			OpenGL extension headers on the <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/">
				SGI website</a>.
			<H2>Why do I have link problems when compiling sample programs under Linux ?</H2>
			Sometimes configure reports gcc as the c++ compiler instead of g++. The result 
			is that the exe file are not linked with the correct run-time library. To 
			correct this simply edit the Makefile in the sample directory and change gcc to 
			g++.

					<h2>I have a compilation error when compiling gluX under Linux (typedef conflict, 
						glXGetProcAddressARB not defined)</h2>
				</b>Please check that your header files (<i>gl.h</i>,<i>glx.h</i> and <i>glxtokens.h</i>
			) are not from Mesa (the word Mesa will appear in the comment at the beginning 
			of the file if it the case). gluX is unfortunately not compatible with Mesa 
			header files ... If you have Mesa header files, please replace them by the 
			OpenGL headers provided - for instance - by NVidia 
			(/usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/include). Then launch configure again.
			<P></P>
			<p>
				<b>
					<h2>Do I need to compile gluX ?</h2>
				</b>
			If you are using gluX under Windows you can directly use the libraries provided 
			in the binary package. Under Linux you have to compile gluX because your 
			computer may have special defintions for extensions (see below).
			<P></P>
			<p>
				<b>
					<h2>The configure script says that glXGetProcAddressARB is not available on my 
						computer ! (Linux)</h2>
				</b>If you are on a SGI workstation, there is no extension loading mechanism 
				and therefore gluX will not compile (this may change in a future release ...)<br>
				If not, please make sure that you have standard OpenGL headers. This error 
				usually comes from a non standard glx.h header file. You can force configure to 
				ignore glXGetProcAddressARB by using the <i>--with-glXGetProcAddressARB</i> command 
				line option. You can also specify which gl.h and glx.h should be used with <i>gl_header=</i>
				and <i>glx_header=</i>
			(see configure --help).
			<P></P>
			<p>
				<b>
					<h2>What is this glux_no_redefine.h file ?</h2>
				</b>
			Under some Linux systems, the gl.h file already includes some extension 
			definitions (the available extensions do not need to be loaded). This file 
			contains the definition of the functions that should not be loaded by gluX. 
			Note that under Windows this file should be empty.
			<P></P>
			<p>
				<b>
					<h2>Why is gluX a shared library under Linux whereas it is a static library under 
						Windows ?</h2>
				</b>As gluX under Linux depends on how the system is configured (see above), it 
				has to be compiled for an individual computer. It is not the case under 
				Windows. However if you compile gluX on a Linux computer with a standard OpenGL 
				installation then you can safely use the library on other computers (and link 
				it statically) = &gt; I strongly recommand to keep a standard OpenGL 
				installation on your computer if you are willing to distribute your programs. 
				To compile gluX as a static library, execute configure, enter the src directory 
				and type <i>make static</i>
			.

				<b>
					<h2>The perl scripts don't work (Linux) !?</h2>
				</b>
			The scripts are assuming that perl is in /usr/bin/perl. If not, modify the 
			first line of the scripts with the correct path to the perl executable.
			<P></P>
			<p>
				<b>
					<h2>I am trying to compile under Windows but ... a lot of source files are missing 
						!?</h2>
				</b>A large part of the gluX source code is generated by the perl script <i>script/gen_plugins.pl</i>. 
				The perl script must be called prior to compiling if the source files are not 
				present. To manually create the source files, enter the script directory and 
				execute <i>perl gen_plugins.pl glext.h wglext.h glxext.h</i>.
				<i><b>This is now done automatically by the CMake script: so simply update gl*.h in the script directory
				and re-run CMake</b></i>.
			<P></P>
			<p>
				<b>
					<h2>I am trying to compile under Windows, the perl script works fine, but I have an 
						error message saying that the linker cannot open an obj file !?</h2>
				</b>The reason is that Visual.NET only tries to compile the files which exist 
				when the compilation starts (and it checks for file existence <i>before</i>
			the pre-build step). As most source files are actually generated by the perl 
			script, the compiler doesn't try to compile them. The solution is simple: 
			launch compilation again and it will work the second time ...
			<P></P>
			<p>
				<b>
					<h2>For some obscure reason, an extension that I don't need refuse to compile ... 
						what can I do ?</h2>
				</b>
			Due to the wide variety of Linux distributions, it is hard to predict every 
			cases that may occur. Therefore, it is possible that an extension refuse to 
			compile on your system. If you do not need this extension (or it is not present 
			on your system) you can simply edit the Makefile and suppress the .cpp/.h files 
			associated with the extension. Note that each time you launch configure the 
			Makefile is generated again.
			<P></P>
			<p>
				<b>
					<h2>How can I add new extensions to gluX ?</h2>
				</b>Simply copy an updated <i>glext.h</i>, <i>glxext.h</i> or <i>wglext.h</i> file 
				into the script directory. Re-run CMake to generate an updated project.
			<P></P>
			<p>
				<b>
					<h2>gluX gives me headaches ! What can I do ?</h2>
				</b>hmmm .... first take a breath, stay calm: beating the screen with the 
				keyboard will not result in any good (I tried ;). You will find in the 
				documentation some links to other extension loading libraries = &gt; try 
				another one :)<br>
			And when you feel better, do not forget to send me an email to explain what you 
			didn't like in gluX.
			<P></P>
