What is gluX ?
--------------
GluX is a cross-platform easy-to-use OpenGL extension loader. 
It offers a very simple mechanism for loading and using OpenGL extensions.
It allows your code to compile under Windows and Linux even if
your video card doesn't support the OpenGL extensions used by your
program: at run time, gluX will detect if required extensions are
present or not.
