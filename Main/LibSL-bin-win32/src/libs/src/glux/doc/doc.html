<a name="intro"><h2>What is gluX ?</h2></a>

GluX is a cross-platform easy-to-use OpenGL extension loader. 
It offers a very simple mechanism for loading and using OpenGL extensions.
It allows your code to compile under Windows and Linux even if
your video card doesn't support the OpenGL extensions used by your
program: at run time, gluX will detect if required extensions are
present or not.

<HR>
<a name="intro"><h2>OpenGL extension loading with gluX</h2></a>

There is two main cases:
<lu>
<li> Your program cannot run without required extensions.
<li> Your program can have different behaviors depending on available extensions.
</lu>

<a name="intro"><h3>If your program cannot run without required extensions</h3></a>

The simplest way to load an extension is to do the following: (<i>sample/sample0.cpp</i>)

<pre>
#include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
#include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;
#include &lt;glux.h&gt;

// declare GL_NV_vertex_program extension as required
<b>GLUX_REQUIRE</b>(GL_NV_vertex_program);

void main(int argc,char **argv)
{
  GLuint vprog;
  
  // init openGL (with glut)
  glutInit(&argc, argv);
  glutInitWindowSize(640, 480);
  glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_DEPTH | GLUT_ALPHA);
  
  // init gluX
  <b>gluxInit();</b>
  
  // if we are here, GL_NV_vertex_program is available !
  // gluX has already stopped the execution if one of the required extensions
  // is not available.

  // let's call some vertex program stuff (just for example)
  cerr &lt;&lt; "Calling glGenProgramsNV ..." &lt;&lt; endl;
  glGenProgramsNV(1,&vprog);
  cerr &lt;&lt; "Calling glBindProgramNV ..." &lt;&lt; endl;
  glBindProgramNV(GL_VERTEX_PROGRAM_NV, vprog);
  cerr &lt;&lt; "Done." &lt;&lt; endl;

}
</pre>

As the extensions are required, gluX will end the execution if one or
more extensions are not available.

<a name="intro"><h3>If your program can have different behaviors depending on available extensions</h3></a>

You can load an extension and manually test if it is available. This can
be useful to implement the same effect on various hardware. For an
example in a video game you want graphics to be as good as possible. 
If your program detects a pixel shader extension it can render a beautiful
bump-mapping, if not it can emulate the effect with standard OpenGL functionalities.

The following code demonstrates how to use gluX to test if an
extension is available: (<i>sample/sample2.cpp</i>)
<pre>
#include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
#include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;
#include &lt;glux.h&gt;

// declare extensions that you want to load
<b>GLUX_LOAD</b>(GL_NV_vertex_program);
<b>GLUX_LOAD</b>(GL_SUN_mesh_array);

void main(int argc,char **argv)
{
  // init openGL (with glut)
  glutInit(&argc, argv);
  glutInitWindowSize(640, 480);
  glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_DEPTH | GLUT_ALPHA);
  
  // init gluX
  <b>gluxInit();</b>
  
  cerr &lt;&lt; "gluX does not stop if a loaded extension is not available." &lt;&lt; endl;
  if (<b>GLUX_IS_AVAILABLE</b>(GL_SUN_mesh_array) == GLUX_AVAILABLE)
    cerr &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "GL_SUN_mesh_array is available" &lt;&lt; endl;
  else
    cerr &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "GL_SUN_mesh_array is *not* available" &lt;&lt; endl;
  if (<b>GLUX_IS_AVAILABLE</b>(GL_NV_vertex_program) == GLUX_AVAILABLE)
    cerr &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "GL_NV_vertex_program is available" &lt;&lt; endl;
  else
    cerr &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "GL_NV_vertex_program is *not* available" &lt;&lt; endl;
  
  cerr &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Done." &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre>

<a name="intro"><h3>If both ?</h3></a>

gluX can handle both cases together. Required extensions should be
declared with <b>GLUX_REQUIRE</b>, the other should be loaded with <b>GLUX_LOAD</b>.
If one of the required extensions is missing, the program will not run.
If multiple files include <b>GLUX_LOAD</b> and <b>GLUX_REQUIRE</b>
instructions for the same extension, only <b>GLUX_REQUIRE</b> is
considered. This mechanism supports static linkage of objects
or static libraries.

<a name="intro"><h3>Do I really have to use <tt>GLUX_REQUIRE</tt> and <tt>GLUX_LOAD</tt>?</h3></a>
No! Since version 1.81, gluX will attempt to load extensions automatically whenever an extension function is first called.
While convenient, this is not very user-friendly since an application will fail unexpectingly 
if a non-available extension is called (with a meaningful error message from gluX). Please note
that profiles are not supported when loading extensions on the fly.

<a name="devl"><h3>DEVL extensions</h3></a>
Sometimes, when an extension is in development the driver hides it:
Functions are present but the extension is not declared as available by the
driver. To load development extensions (marked as DEVL by gluX), call
<i>gluxInit</i> with the <b>GLUX_DEVL</b> flag. Be aware that <b>these
extensions may not work properly</b>.

<a name="intro"><h3>Loading all extensions</h3></a>

In some cases you may want your program to load all the
extensions. This can be done easily by including <i>&lt;glux_load_all.h&gt;</i>
instead of <i>&lt;glux.h&gt;</i>.
Then you can use the macro <b>GLUX_IS_AVAILABLE</b> to check whether
an extension is available at runtime.

<a name="status"><h3>Extension status</h3></a>

At startup gluX displays the status of each required/loaded
extension. The different status are:

<ul>
<li> <pre>[ OK ] GL_ARB_extension</pre> Extension is available
<li> <pre>[FAIL] GL_ARB_extension</pre> Extension is not available
<li> <pre>[DEVL] GL_ARB_extension</pre> Extension seems to be
available (functions are present but the extension is not declared
as available by the driver). See <a href="#devl">DEVL extensions</a>
for more information.
<li> <pre>[XXXX] GL_ARB_extension</pre> Extension is available but has
been disabled to emulate a profile. See 
<a href="doc.html#profiles">gluX Extension Profiles</a> for more
information.
</ul>

<a name="intro"><h3>glux namespace</h3></a>

To avoid conflicts all functions loaded by gluX are in the <i>glux</i>
namespace. By default, the header <i>&lt;glux.h&gt;</i> declares
<pre>using namespace glux;</pre>. This can be disabled by defining
<i>GLUX_EXPLICIT_NAMESPACE</i> before including
<i>&lt;glux.h&gt;</i>. In this case, a function
<i>glDoSomethingCool</i> should be called with
<i>glux::glDoSomethingCool</i>.

<HR>
<a name="profiles"><h2>gluX Extension Profiles</h2></a>
<p>
Very often applications are developed on powerful graphics hardware but
are designed to support less powerful hardware (well, the
non-hardcore-gamer user :-).
</p><p>
Testing what your application will look like may not be
easy: Deactivating extension loading mechanism by commenting some
parts of the code is really not a good solution (well, anyone who
released an application with his never-seen-before-effect disabled
knows what I mean :-)
</p><p>
Therefore gluX now supports <i>extension profiles</i>. The idea is to
ask gluX to emulate less powerful hardware by disabling some
extensions. Since gluX cannot emulate extensions that your hardware
doesn't support, this mechanism works only to emulate hardware whose
extension set is included in the installed graphic card extension set 
(like emulating a GeForce3 with a GeForceFX).
</p>

<a name="profile"><h3>Using a gluX profile</h3></a>

To use a specific gluX extension profile you just need to give the
filename of the gluX profile as the second argument of
<b>gluxInit()</b>. Some predefined profiles are given in the
<i>profiles</i> directory of the gluX distribution.

<a name="createprofile"><h3>How to create a gluX profile</h3></a>

The tool <i>gluxinfo</i>, available in the gluX distribution, produces
gluX extension profiles when called without any argument. Called with
a profile filename as first argument it checks whether the profile is
compatible with your current graphics hardware.
Some predefined profiles are also given in the <i>profiles</i>
directory of the gluX distribution. Feel free to send me more profiles !

<a name="intro"><h2>gluX robustness</h2></a>

<p>
If you forget to declare an extension with <b>GLUX_REQUIRE</b> or <b>GLUX_LOAD</b>,
or simply forget to call <b>gluxInit()</b>, gluX will have a robust behavior: 
if you call one extension function, the execution will be stopped and
gluX will print a message indicating witch function of witch extension
failed to execute. (see <i>sample/sample3.cpp</i>).
</p>

<a name="intro"><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></a>

Please read the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<HR>
<a name="intro"><h2>Where's the mad guy who wrote 200+ extensions loading code ?</h2></a>

gluX is based on a Perl script that parses the OpenGL extension registry
and generates the loading code. The only operation needed to update
gluX is to launch the automated script: gluX could include any newer
extension without any more pain !

<HR>
<a name="intro"><h2>Note for SGI users</h2></a>

It seams that the SGI implementation of OpenGL does not provide the
<i>glXGetProcAddress</i> function that is needed to compile gluX.
As a consequence gluX does not compile on SGI station and is not
available on this platform.

<HR>
<a name="intro"><h2>Where can I found informations about OpenGL extensions ?</h2></a>

All extension's functions and defines could be found in the <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/">OpenGL extension registry</a>.

<HR>
<a name="intro"><h2>Is there another libs that can be used to load
OpenGL extensions ?</h2></a>

To my knowledge the following libraries allow OpenGL extension
loading (if you know another library, please send me a link):

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/sdk.html">SGI
OpenGL SDK and Intel GLsdk Library</a>
